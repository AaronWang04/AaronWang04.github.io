Hello! I'm Aaron Wang, a third-year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Engineering. Currently, I am interning at [CentML]() as a ML Systems Engineer and I help with optimizing LLM inferencing.

I have previously worked at [Huawei Technologies](https://www.huawei.com/ca/) as a research engineer intern on the AI infrastructure team. I am the author of a paper (currently under review!) on networking 

On the side, I also help lead & write drone software at the [University of Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group](https://www.uwarg.com/)
